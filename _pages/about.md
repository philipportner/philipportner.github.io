Hello there!

I am a PhD student at the [DAMS Lab](https://www.tu.berlin/en/dams) (data
management for data science laboratory) at the Technical University of Berlin
under the supervision of [Matthias Boehm](https://mboehm7.github.io/) and
[Patrick Damme](https://pdamme.github.io/). There I am working on the
[DAPHNE](https://daphne-eu.eu/) project.

My research interests lie in the systems programming domain, more specifically,
compilers, database systems, and machine learning systems.


I did my masters at the Technical University of Graz working on an
[MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) based compiler for Large-Scale Data Management,
HPC and Machine Learning Systems.
Before that, I wrote my undergraduate thesis at the Secure Systems group at the
[IAIK](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/research-area/securesystems/) lead by [Daniel
Gruss](https://gruss.cc/), where I implemented new versions of the
[Spectre](https://meltdownattack.com/) attack.

Alongside my studies I have worked as a software engineer and as a teaching
assistant at the Institute of Technical Informatics in the area of Embedded
Systems.
