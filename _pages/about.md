Hello there!

I am a Computer Science student currently finishing my masters degree at the 
Technical University of Graz.

My research interests are compilers, database systems, and machine learning systems.


My masters thesis work is focused on the [DAPHNE](https://daphne-eu.eu/) project.
There I am working on a [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) based compiler for Large-Scale Data Management, HPC and
Machine Learning Systems.

Afterwards I will be joining the DAMS Lab (data management for data science laboratory)
at the Technical University of Berlin under the supervision of [Matthias Boehm](https://mboehm7.github.io/).

I wrote my undergraduate thesis at the Secure Systems group at the 
[IAIK](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/research-area/securesystems/) lead by [Daniel Gruss](https://gruss.cc/), where
I implemented new versions of the [Spectre](https://meltdownattack.com/) attack.

Alongside my studies I have worked as a software engineer and I also worked as a teaching assistant at the 
Institute of Technical Informatics in the area of
Embedded Systems.
